As we move closer to our midterm project, "Zookeeper's Challenge," I'm introducing a two-week period, Module05 Activities, focused on review and preparation. This time allows for reflection on our progress and preparation for the upcoming challenge.

Module05 Goals:

Reflection and Planning: Reflect on the "Zookeeper's Challenge" requirements. Think about your program's design and the data structures that will best meet the needs of organizing animals and managing data from arrivingAnimals.txt and animalNames.txt.

Design Focus: Focus on your midterm program's design. Which data structures will you use, and how will they work together?

Review: Use this time to review any topics that are unclear. Practice with concepts and coding patterns that have been introduced.

Discussion: Engage in the course forum. Ask questions, share ideas, and help your classmates.

Tasks for Module05:

Design Document: Create a design document for your midterm project. Include components, data structures, and their interactions.

Code Review: Choose a piece of code you've worked on. Review and improve it. Be ready to discuss your process in class.

Experiment: Try different data structures and see how they might fit into your project. Test your ideas with small code segments.

Forum Participation: Post at least once in the discussion forum. Ask a question, offer a suggestion, or provide help.

Additional Guidance:

If you encounter a difficult concept, engage in the forum discussions. If a topic proves particularly challenging, suggest a video explanation from me on that subject.

This period is a chance to solidify your understanding and approach the midterm with confidence. Use it to ensure your foundation is strong and your project plan is well thought out.

Submit any Java source code you created this module. Note that there is an approved solution posted after Module 09 if you get stuck on anything.
